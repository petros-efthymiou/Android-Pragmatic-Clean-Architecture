Android Pragmatic Clean Architecture
=========================================
Introduction
------------
This repo is an example of the powerful Mobile Pragmatic Clean Architecture and is offered as an appendix to the book <INSERT_BOOK_NAME_AND_LINK>. The book is covering all the aspects of building Clean Mobile Applications and explains the reasoning behind all the decisions made in this sample project.

This architecture is primarily intended for educational purposes and aims to describe engineering concepts and practices such as:

* Clean architecture
* MVI
* Inversion of Control
  * Dependency Inversion
  * Dependency Injection
* S.O.L.I.D principles
* Reactive Programming
* Unit testing
* UI Testing
* Segregation into independent modules
* Packaging


Pragmatic Clean Architecture is intended to be a flexible Mobile Architecture that respects the S.O.L.I.D principles Clean Architecture guidelines. It can be used in applications of any complexity and will ensure their scalability to fully grown enterprise apps when the need arises.

For a more elaborate architecture, aimed solely for large-scale, enterprise apps you can refer to the other example included in the book [Mobile Microservices Architecture](https://github.com/petros-efthymiou/Mobile-Android-Microservices-Architecture).


Clean Layering

The diagram above describes the layering of the project. The thick lines indicate hard boundaries, separation in modules while the thin lines represent soft boundaries, separation in packages.
