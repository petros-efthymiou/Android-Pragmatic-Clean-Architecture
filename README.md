Android Pragmatic Clean Architecture
=========================================
Introduction
------------
This repo is an example of the powerful Mobile Pragmatic Clean Architecture and is offered as an appendix to the book [Clean Mobile Architecture](https://www.petrosefthymiou.com/product-page). The book covers all the aspects of building Clean Mobile Applications and explains the reasoning behind all the decisions made in this sample project.

This architecture is primarily intended for educational purposes and aims to describe engineering concepts and practices such as:

* Clean architecture
* MVI
* Inversion of Control
  * Dependency Inversion
  * Dependency Injection
* S.O.L.I.D principles
* Reactive Programming
* Unit testing
* UI Testing
* Proper package segregation


Pragmatic Clean Architecture is intended to be a flexible Mobile Architecture that respects the S.O.L.I.D principles, Clean Architecture, and other mobile best practices. It can be used in applications of any complexity and will ensure their scalability to fully grown enterprise apps should the need arise.

The technology stack includes:
* Jetpack Compose
* Jetpack Navigation
* Coroutines
* Kotlin Flow
* State Flow
* Retrofit
* Koin


Pragmatic Clean Layering

The diagram above describes the layering of the project. The thick lines indicate hard boundaries, and separation in modules, while the thin lines represent soft boundaries and separation in packages.
